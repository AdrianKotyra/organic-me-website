# Organic ME Website
##  Project Overview

After completing courses on Udemy about React.js and PHP, which significantly improved my overall coding skills, I took on another exciting project as part of my HNC in Web and Software Development at Edinburgh College's Milton campus. This project involved creating a website using pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, allowing me to apply my strengthened skills and further hone my abilities.

By this stage, I had become very confident in my frontend development capabilities. I could replicate complex designs from scratch with precision, thanks to my deep understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Despite my proficiency in coding, I was aware that my design skills still had room for improvement, so I focused on understanding the principles of good design and usability to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the site.

This project provided an excellent opportunity to put my skills to the test. I meticulously recreated the given design, ensuring pixel-perfect precision and responsiveness across various devices. The use of vanilla JavaScript allowed me to build dynamic and interactive elements, enhancing the functionality and user engagement of the website.

Overall, this project not only solidified my confidence in frontend development but also showcased my ability to build functional, efficient, and visually appealing websites from scratch. The knowledge gained from the React.js and PHP courses enriched my coding skills, enabling me to approach this project with a more comprehensive understanding of web development principles.
